# Firefox heavily customized

I use [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) to interact with Firefox. Tridactyl is a plugin that gives you the ability to use vim key bindings to navigate. So I disabled the search and address bar and I'm also using KDE plasma with global menus and therefore I don't have to use the application menu.
