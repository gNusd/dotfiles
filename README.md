# gnus' .files

These are some of my dotfiles. I have gotten a lot of inspiration from other peoples dotfiles and it also contain snippets from some of these files.

There are some legacy files that is not being used currently.

Files not currently in use:

* .vimrc - are using neovim now, '.neovimrc' -> .config/nvim/init.vim
* .ncmpcpp
* .config/qutebrowser
